# Inkshop is about people.

Inkshop is a human-centered framework for running your small business.  Website, mailing list, store, and reporting all in one.  It's also free.

Inkshop sticks out because it's people-focused.  It treats your customers and visitors like people, not data-points.

That means no creepy tracking, no big-data segmentation, and encryption baked-in to provide strong privacy protection for both you and your customers. 

Feedback, improvements, and contributions are welcome. :)


## Project Overview:

I'm bootstrapping this project on my own site, [Ink and Feet](https://inkandfeet.com). 

You can read more about the decision to move to inkshop in [this open letter.]()

I'll be moving from a setup with:
- Static site generated by inkblock, and served by Dreamhost and Cloudflare
- Mailing list managed by Ontraport
- Redirects and url shortening run by inkdots
- Digital product sales managed by Ontraport and Teachery


When it's at 1.0, this project will let you:
- Manage an email list, using best practices for deliverability
- Host a website, with pages and blog posts
- Sell downloadable digital products
- Sell online digital products, including customer authentication and secure data storage
- Understand what pages are generating the most traffic
- Create shortened URLs for sharing with social media
- Share posts to social media via buffer
- Protect your sanity against trolls and abusive people

## Current status:

[![TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/inkandfeet/inkshop.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/inkandfeet/inkshop)

It just got started, on April 15 2019.   Mailing list is the first thing to build. Target for basic mailing list is April 21, 2019.

This will include:
- Subscribe
- Send message to my list
- Import
- Unsubscribe
- Love
- Receive replies


## Bootstrapping

```bash
git clone https://github.com/inkandfeet/inkshop.git

```


## Running tests

Tests are wrapped with [polytester](https://github.com/skoczen/polytester).

One-offs:

```bash
docker-compose run inkshop pt
```

Development:

```bash
docker-compose run inkshop pt --autoreload
```
