# Inkshop

Simple stores and hosting for digital products.

Sell and provide access to digital products - both downloads and ones you're hosting, all from a single domain.

Authentication and encrypted storage for users to save data using your products, automatically included. (via by [inkDB](https://github.com/inkandfeet/inkdb))

Turn-key integration with Stripe.

All the user-friendly things you'd expect.  Password reset, two-factor authentication, GDPR compliance.


Tech: 
- current inkdots proxy under the hood, routing content from a statically hosted site.
- an authorized, inkdb included into any HTML pages.
